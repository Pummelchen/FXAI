# FXPlugins

Repository-root source area for future plugin implementations shared across FXAI runtimes.

AI plugins own model execution. When a converted plugin needs tensor training or inference, it should use a plugin-local PyTorch or TensorFlow backend rather than re-creating the old MQL5 `TensorCore` inside Swift FXDataEngine.

Converted plugins should consume the Swift FXDataEngine OHLCV contracts and use volume-derived features whenever the loaded dataset has nonzero volume.

The current MT5/MQL5 plugin implementation remains under `FXAI/FXPlugins/`.
